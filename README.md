# Blogging_Website
It is a Spring-based application, used for posting different category blogs post and each blog can have various comments on it by other users.

I have used role base authorization so only the admin can remove any category and post. For security, I have used Spring Security and JWT token

I have also implemented Swagger API for documenting the APIs

Technologies Used: React.js, Java, Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate, Spring Security, JWT Authorization, MySQL, Pagination, Swagger UI
